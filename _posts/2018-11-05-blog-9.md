This past week has been full of great experiences and extensive introspection. First, beginning with my plans for my original work, I’ve contemplated making some interesting additions in order to improve the presentability of my project. Using raspberry pis or another microprocessor like an arduino with some minor modifications, I could create a conversational AI which actually speaks back to the user. I’m going to keep this in the back of my mind as I continue finishing the functionality of my original work, so that I can possibly budget some time to adding this after the most crucial parts are completed. Second, I’ve had a lot of fun looking into my past experiences in ISM as I gear up for giving a speech at the Society for Information Management meeting today, as well as my ISM research speech in class this week. I’ve been looking at the sum of my experiences and the concepts I have explored recently in order to influence my choices for my choice of mentor, as well as the timeline of my project. I have been contemplating extending my original work into a year long objective which will culminate into my final product, and present a polished version of my socialbot. Overall, I’m excited for this week and ready to establish connections with some influential leaders in the field.
