My latest discovery has been Quantopian, an extensive Python library and standalone educational platform about quant trading. I gathered plenty of knowledge about scraping databases and websites through the manual retrieval of data and various computations using these values, but this has absolutely changed my perspective of this project. I can already envision how I would instead carry out the majority of this project using Quantopian instead, and because I am emphasizing the learning experience of my Final Product, I really believe this is just the best option at this point in the game. Already, I’ve seen some new concepts being introduced, including the values of alpha and beta, corresponding to the success of the investment in comparison to the broader market and the volatility, respectively. I still get the feeling that I am such a novice in the field of investing that whenever I have the chance to simplify things and condense the number of variables involved, I usually see the opportunity as favorable. However, at times I feel like I am cheating or somehow bypassing the actual process, even though so many professionals use shortcuts to get jobs done in actual work environments as well. Nonetheless, I feel as if I’ve made my decision at this point, and I’m now excited to see how this product will turn out.
