# Project

* Most of my research for this project can be seen under the Research tab in both the primary and secondary assessments. Below is the first test of my purely machine learning-based program. It has some difficulties at this point, but I'm eager to make changes and will post updates on it in the future.

* Most of my code revolved around simply accessing data

<code>c.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parent_post(id int PRIMARY KEY, comment_id TEXT UNIQUE, parent_id TEXT UNIQUE, parent TEXT, comment TEXT, subreddit TEXT, score INT)")</code>

* or manipulating it.



* The simplest, yet most emphasized part, was the implementation of the Long Short-Term Memory model and corresponding layers within it.
