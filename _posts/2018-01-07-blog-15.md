This winter break has been, without a doubt, the best I have experienced in the past four years of high school. I may have ended up having less time for working on some of my assignments or academic objectives, but I absolutely made the most of my time each and every day. I’ve found that with more activities and plans, I actually end up being able to fit more work into the day. I get into a mode where I feel more urgency, and not in a negative way, but more of a positive reassurance  that I can properly motivate myself when needed. 

As far as my progress in ISM goes, I’ve truly enjoyed designing a new display board for Research Showcase this year. I think now that I have a chatbot for my original work this year, I’m very excited to see how I can integrate it into my presentation and engage people attending the showcase. I think using voice recognition incorporated into a project which has such a high level of user interaction will be amazing for such an event. In combination with a new board that simulates the look of a classic motherboard, this should be a great way to improve the amount of user engagement I had compared to last year’s showcase. Overall, I look forward to seeing how showcase goes next week, and I will strive to make my presentation as entertaining and informative as possible.
