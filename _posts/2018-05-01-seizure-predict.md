* This was a fairly naive yet fun Python project I created using Support Vector Machines and different features engineered from a dataset
which included electroencephalogram frequency values over time. I transformed the data with a Fourier transform but also used the root mean square speed and max value of the original data to create a matrix of data to input into an SVM. The results were fairly accurate in terms of recall, but I would most likely need to perform tests on a much larger data set because there weren't too many points in the set I found. All of the methods I used in this project are fairly naive and not perfected, but it was a good learning experience for one of my first machine learning projects.
