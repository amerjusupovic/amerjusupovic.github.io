As I’ve begun to research even more for my Final Product, I’ve realized just how simple yet deceiving the stock market can be. Simply put, there are two main aspects to trading, namely the long-term and short-term strategies. The long-term is more suited for someone who studies the stocks all day, and finds a real interest in tracking current events and the actions of these companies. The short-term is more suited for someone who studies the logistics behind trading, tracking the trends and patterns with less emphasis on the real-life reasoning behind them. In the past few weeks, I’ve begun to realize that the idea of both the short and long-term applies to so many aspects of life. Sometimes it pays to be more analytical in my thinking, like when I approached the issue of fixing the filepaths for the libraries I installed just recently. However, recently much more of my life has required more of a bigger-picture perspective, like handling relationships between people and with professionals. I think considering these two different approaches with everything I do has now made me a more understanding and considerate person overall. I really look forward to continuing my progress on my product and on my development as a person through the coming weeks in ISM.
