Independent Study and Mentorship is a program offered as a course across all Frisco ISD high school campuses. ISM allows students to focus on a topic of study and research their career of choice or any field for which they have a passion. The course includes creating written research assessments providing analysis of secondary sources, informational interviews with professionals, working directly with a mentor, and creating a professional resume. The course allows students to practice in areas such as public speaking, research, time management, communication, networking, interviewing, and goal setting as well. Finally, the students create two projects known as the original work and final product to present their accomplishments over the course of the school year at their final presentation.
