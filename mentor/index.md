Viju Kothuvatiparambil is currently working as the Team Lead for Artificial Intelligence at Bank of America from his office in the Dallas area. As one of the lead developers for the Erica personal banking assistant, he has 22 years of experience in software development and over 5 years in artificial intelligence/machine learning and natural language processing. He has a wealth of experience developing software in a corporate setting and fully understands the limitations many businesses have, especially on the amount of money and time they have to spend on website and mobile applications. Because of this, he decided to found his company Mindmax Software Solutions in 2011, tasked to help small businesses and individuals who hope to create their own online applications.
For his college education, Mr. Kothuvatiparambil went to the National Institute of Technology at Calicut for his Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and his Master's in Structural Engineering. Beginning in 2015, he has been working on getting his Master's in Computational Linguistics as well. 
Outside of his work at Bank of America, Mr. Kothuvatiparambil enjoys spending time with his family and creating applications for his company, Mindmax Software Solutions.
